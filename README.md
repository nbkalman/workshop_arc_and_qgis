# ArcPro and QGIS side-by-side
## 1. Intro
I designed this #maptimeDavis workshop as a long-time Esri desktop software user who recently tried making the switch to QGIS. As any software user can tell you, it is sometimes difficult to make a switch when you are already used to doing things a certain way. Something that is easy and takes five minutes in one environment suddenly takes 2 hours and several internet searches. This can be a barrier to a more robust interaction with a great new tool. 

There can be several reasons that it is desirable or even required to move from ArcGIS to QGIS or vice versa. You may be starting a new job that requires one or the other. There can be licensing issues that make open source attractive or necessary. Maybe a tool or process works better in one application than the other. This workshop addresses some of the common spatial data and GIS tasks you will likely need in your workflow, making it easier to use either platform as it suits your needs. 

QGIS and ArcPro are both incredibly powerful pieces of software. This workshop is NOT an endorsement of one over the other, nor is it meant to settle any debates about which is better. This is also not an “introduction to GIS” workshop. As much as I encourage solid GIS concepts over button-pushing, this is a button-pushing workshop, meant to help you get through some common workflows. Because of time constraints, the content is limited to vector data.

### 1.1 Outline
The topics covered are:
* Opening the software and creating a project
* The map interface
* Adding data to the map
* Symbolizing data
* Labels
* Creating and editing features
* Creating and editing attributes
* Making a map layout

### 1.2 Software
This workshop was created using QGIS 3.24 (Tisler) and ArcPro 3.2. Most of the content here is relevant for slightly older or newer versions on both platforms.
